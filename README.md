# Schrodinger-NumericalSolvers

Numerical solutions of the **1D Schr√∂dinger equation** in a finite quantum well using **Finite Difference (FD)** and **Numerov** methods.

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the **numerical solution of the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation** for a **1D finite quantum well**.  
Two classical numerical methods are implemented and compared:

- **Finite Difference Method (FD)**  
- **Numerov Method**  

The program computes:  
- **Bound states (eigenenergies)** inside the potential well  
- **Even and odd eigenfunctions**  
- **Comparison with theoretical values**  

It also provides **visualizations** of the normalized wavefunctions obtained by both methods, making it a practical tool for studying numerical quantum mechanics.

## üî¨ Key Features

- Clean and modular Python implementation  
- Bisection algorithm for eigenvalue calculation  
- Normalized eigenfunction plotting (up to 6 bound states)  
- Comparison of FD vs Numerov accuracy and efficiency

## üìä Results

- Eigenenergies are computed and compared against theoretical values.  
- Six wavefunctions are plotted:
  - 3 obtained with the **Finite Difference method** (even and odd states)  
  - 3 obtained with the **Numerov method**  

This allows a direct visual comparison between methods.
